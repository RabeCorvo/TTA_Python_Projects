Python Projects

These are some small projcts I made using Python

Projects:



Car Insurance, TwentyOne, Newsletter,

Car Insurance: This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

TwentyOne: This project is a fully functional twenty one game played through the console. It deals cards to the user and a dealer and allows the player to decide how much to bet and whether to hit or stay.

Newsletter: This is another MVC web application that mimics a newsletter signup page. It utilizes a database first setup which saves user information to a local database and then returns the list of people on the newsletter mailing linst in an admin page.
