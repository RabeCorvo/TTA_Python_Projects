Python Projects

These are some small projcts I made using Python

Projects:



BigfootApp, Django_Checkbook, Newsletter,

BigFootApp: This project is an app that was designed to take advantage of Python and Django features.  Using Python, Django, SQLite, HTML and CSS, the app keeps track of user input data using a form.

Django_Checkbook: A small app designed to keep track of money in a digital checkbook.

DjangoUniversity: Another simple app designed to enroll students into a fictional school.

TTA Game: This was a little console game I created while studying the Python language.  It is very basic and silly but fun. The program was an excercise in learning the basic ins and outs of Python.
