Project Scope:
Create an app designed to take advantage of Python and Django features.  Using Python, Django, SQLite, HTML and CSS, the app keeps track of user inputed data using a form.  All stories were required to be tested and debugged before sumbission.

Stories I completed:

Story #1: Build the basic app
In the story, I created a new app in PyCharm.  Using a virtual environment, I created a base template and home templeate along with the function to render them.  The home page was linked to the main projects homepage along with a thumbnail.  I chose to implement a few bootstrap items to aide in the look of the base template.

Story #2: Create your model
This story was all about making a model as well as a form to save the data collection to the database.  The choice of what data to be collected was completely up to me.  A particular interesting lesson for me on this was learning which fields were truly needed for the scope of the project.  A template was made to allow for creating the new item.  

Story #3: Index Page
Once a data collection was saved in the database successfully, I was tasked with creating another template to display all database entries.  Specific information from the collection that was actually displayed was completely up to me.  A Django filter was required in this step.

Story #4: Details Page
This story tasked me to create a template that displays one instance from the database.  Links were added from the index page that directed the user to the specific entries details page for the item.

Story #5: Edit and Delete Functions
Finally, this story required me to allow the single selected item from the details page to be either edited or deleted.  It required more functions to be added that saved edits as well as confirmed deletion requests.

Other Skills Learned:
Team communication:   Took part in daily standups that helped provide both self-introspection and updates to other team members.  
Version Control:  Cloned a remote master branch, updated it daily, created new local branches, managed merges, pull requests, and push requests.
